Hi, My name is <b>Marko Canovic</b>. I am student of <b>Mechanical Engineering in Belgrade</b>.<br>
Around year ago i decided that i want to become <b>Front End Developer</b>. 
Right now I am looking for practice in IT industry.<br>
Highly motivated to learn new and exciting programming languages.
With my eye for detail there is no room for errors ;-) <br>
Working under pressure is not something i am cheering by i can handle it.
I am always open for constructive criticism, because i believe that criticism push us to become better developer.
